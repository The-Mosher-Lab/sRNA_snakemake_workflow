This directory should contain your reference genome for chloroplast and 
mitochondrial reads (a fasta file), which are filtered out as part of the 
pipeline. Upon running the pipeline, the reference genome will be indexed, 
which speeds up the aligning process. The index files will appear in this
directory.
