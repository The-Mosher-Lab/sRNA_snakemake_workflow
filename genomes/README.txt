This folder contains the subdirectories for the reference genomes necessary
to run the pipeline. Your reference genome for chloroplast and mitochondrial
reads, which are filtered out as part of the pipeline, should go in the
chloroplast_mitochondiron directory as a fasta file. Your reference genome
for non-sRNAs, which are filtered out as part of the pipeline, should
go in the filter_rna directory as a fasta file. Your complete reference 
genome for your organism, against which sRNA reads are mapped, should go in 
the reference_genome directory as a fasta file.
